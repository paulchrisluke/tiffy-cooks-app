Slide 1 — Title

TiffyCooks Community — Powered by PCL Labs
Subtitle: A new platform for food lovers to learn, share, and grow — launching January 2026

Intro bullets:

Built by PCL Labs, the growth + tech team behind tiffycooks.com’s SEO and monetization success

Core team: Julia (Growth & Strategy), Chris (CTO), Danny (Developer)

Proven track record: scaled tiffycooks.com to 1M+ daily visitors and $30K+/mo in Google Ads revenue

Next step: launch a community platform that builds new revenue streams while protecting Tiffy’s core brand

Slide 2 — Vision

Header:
Turn fans into community — and community into sustainable revenue.

Concept:
We’ll build a standalone food community platform where:

Users can learn from Tiffy’s recipes, share their own variations, and interact directly with each other.

An AI cooking assistant, trained on Tiffy’s style and recipes, helps members cook smarter and stay engaged.

Most content remains free and ad-supported (to drive SEO), with optional memberships for deeper access, live sessions, or exclusive features.

Built for scale:

Hosted on a new domain (so Tiffy can sell it independently).

Redirected and linked from learn.tiffycooks.com for SEO crawlability and audience continuity.
